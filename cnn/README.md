## CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNNs

This repository implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using **PyTorch** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.

### Key Experiments
The project focuses on optimizing training dynamics and improving generalization through:
* **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Extensive experimentation with various strategies from `torch.optim.lr_scheduler` to control step size.
* **Data Augmentation**: Application of different augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.

### Experiment Tracking
Training metrics, including **Loss** and **Accuracy** (on both training and validation sets), were logged and visualized using **Comet.ml**.
